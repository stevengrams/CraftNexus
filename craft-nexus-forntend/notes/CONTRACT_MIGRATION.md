# Contract Migration Summary

## ✅ Migration Complete

The smart contract has been successfully moved from `craft-nexus/contracts/escrow/` to `craft-nexus-contract/` in the root directory for better separation and maintainability.

## 📁 New Structure

```
CraftNexus/
├── craft-nexus/              # Frontend application
│   ├── lib/stellar/          # Stellar integration (references contract)
│   └── scripts/
│       └── deploy-contract.sh # Deployment script (updated paths)
│
└── craft-nexus-contract/     # Smart contract (separate directory)
    ├── src/
    │   └── lib.rs            # Contract source code
    ├── Cargo.toml            # Rust dependencies
    └── README.md             # Contract documentation
```

## 🔄 What Changed

### Files Moved
- ✅ `craft-nexus/contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs` → `craft-nexus-contract/src/lib.rs`
- ✅ `craft-nexus/contracts/escrow/Cargo.toml` → `craft-nexus-contract/Cargo.toml`
- ✅ `craft-nexus/contracts/escrow/README.md` → `craft-nexus-contract/README.md`

### Files Updated
- ✅ `craft-nexus/scripts/deploy-contract.sh` - Updated paths to reference new location
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated all contract location references
- ✅ `craft-nexus/HACKATHON_SETUP.md` - Updated deployment instructions
- ✅ `STELLAR_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Updated file structure documentation

### Files Deleted
- ✅ Removed old `craft-nexus/contracts/escrow/` directory and contents

## 🚀 Usage

### Building the Contract

```bash
cd craft-nexus-contract
soroban contract build
```

### Deploying the Contract

From the `craft-nexus` directory:

```bash
cd craft-nexus
./scripts/deploy-contract.sh testnet YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

The script automatically finds the contract in `../craft-nexus-contract/`

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Contract code is separate from frontend code
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Contract can be developed and versioned independently
3. **Clearer Structure**: Root-level contract directory makes it obvious this is a separate component
4. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing logic still works, just with updated paths

## 📝 Notes

- The TypeScript integration in `craft-nexus/lib/stellar/contracts.ts` remains unchanged and continues to work
- The contract interface doesn't need updates - it only interacts via the deployed contract address
- All deployment scripts have been updated to use the new paths
